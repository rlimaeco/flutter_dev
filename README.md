* `flutter run --release`

The `flutter run --release` command both builds and installs the Flutter app.

## Internationalization

This app has been internationalized (just enough to show how it's
done). It's an example of how one can do so with the
[Dart intl package](https://pub.dev/packages/intl).

The [Flutter Internationalization Tutorial](https://flutter.dev/tutorials/internationalization/)
covers Flutter app internationalization in general.

See [regenerate.md](lib/i18n/regenerate.md) for an explanation
of how the Dart internationalization tools, like
`intl_translation:generate_from_arb`, were used to generate
localizations for this app.
